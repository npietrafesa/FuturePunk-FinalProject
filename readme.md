# Deltron News - A View of News From the Future

## The Story
This story entails a future of the United States where the government is dominated by very conservative and religious people, and a new president is 
elected with these ideals. He turns the country to a theocracy essentially, which has a hard emphasis on traditional Christian values and has lots of 
censorship for things deemed "un-christian." The main emphasis of this story is on music, and you will see that music is heavily censored within the 
country, to the point where people essentially cannot express themselves as they please. In particular all hip-hop is banned, because it is deemed to be 
"too violent," no matter what the song is. One rapper decides to go against this idea and releases an album where he puts all of his emotions into a hip-
hop album, creating this very intense, erratic sounding album. 

The album is *By the Time I get to Phoenix*, which is actually a real album, by the rap 
group *Injury Reserve*, a link to the album is [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/7L7oMPboBCeyGLJVsHSWM2?si=K82Jk2Q3QsmJcrtMgpnPOg). The reason I chose 
this album is because not only is it one of my favorite albums ever, I believe the music in this album will set precedents for future music, because of how 
unique it sounds.

Eventually, the president will be forced to resign, and beyond that, the story is up to your own interpretation.

The story of this is also based on another album I really enjoy, called *Deltron 3030*, by Deltron 3030, which you can find [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/04uhhcjGVCHodMgZjXOlye?si=cJN4_fNgRqOQwRZJWWYNQA). I won't get into the detail of this album here, but you can research on 
it if you are interested at all. This is also loosely influenced by a real life event known as the Singin revolution, which happened in the 1990s in 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Essentially, they used music as a way to express their own individuality and to protest against the Soviet Government 
controlling them. Eventually, with enough protests, they all gained independence from the USSR. If you are curious, you can read more about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution).

## About the Website
This is a demo website envisioning what a news website might look like and what might happen in the future. Because it is a demo website, this is the only 
page available. The other buttons, such as the ones at the very top and bottom of the website, do not work, they only are there to make the website look 
more complete and realistic to an actual news website. The only things that are interactible are the articles themselves. When you click the titles, the 
corresponding article will appear on the right side of the screen. I know real news websites don't do this, but this was more of a design choice I thought 
would be interesting to make. When you click the close button, the article will close, and when you click on another article, the previous article will 
close and the new one will appear.
