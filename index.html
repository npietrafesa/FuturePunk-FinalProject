    <h2>Charles Miller elected as the 50th President of the United States</h2>
    <h4>Jan 6, 2036</h4>
    <p>After a rather tumultuous election, Charles Miller is elected president of the United States, winning both the popular vote and electoral college votes. Miller has announced he plans to execute his ideas of creating a more “Christian America”. He is backed up by the Congress and Senate, so it is believed he will be able to pass his laws with ease.</p>
    <p>The result of the election seems to have a mixed reception from Americans. While some are very satisfied with the idea of bringing back a more Christian America, others are worried.</p>
    <p>“I’m worried about Miller being in office now. I fear he'll start taking away our civil liberties in the name of religion. I hope that I will be wrong about this, but the future looks bleak to me,” said one worried voter.</p>
    <p>While it is unclear if this comment has any merit, only time will tell whether this becomes true or not.</p>
    <p>As the next few months unfold, we will surely see what President Miller will take the direction of his new Christian America.</p>
