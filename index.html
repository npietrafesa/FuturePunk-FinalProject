    <h2>Charles Miller steps down as president of America</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <h4>January 5, 2047</h4>
    <p>Charles Miller steps down after receiving much pressure from countrywide protests calling for his resignation. He announced late this afternoon that he would resign from office.</p>
    <p>Many Americans are overjoyed to hear his resignation, which marks the end of 11 years of Miller’s Presidency.</p>
    <p>“This is a step in the right direction. Now we can start to repair this country and fix its laws,” said one protestor. “The future for America looks bright,” said another protestor.</p>
    <p>It has not been decided yet who will take the place of the vacant president space, but there will be an election - the first in 11 years - to elect a new president. The next election is sure to be critical for the future of the United States, and will hopefully be the stepping stone back to the old government.</p>

    <h2>Second wave of protests break out following the arrest of Nathaniel Ritchie</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <h4>September 15, 2046</h4>
    <p>Nathaniel Ritchie, a rapper, has been arrested this morning by government officials. This arrest has sparked a
        new wave of protests across America, even larger than the 28th Amendment Protests.</p>
    <p>Ritchie has gained much notoriety in the government after creating the album <i>By the Time I Get to Phoenix</i>, a
        hip-hop album solely about expressing oneself in an extremely intense.</p>
    <p>The album, which is a tense and emotional listen, goes completely against the government's ideals by expressing
        himself as who he is on the album. The album was never officially released since it is a hip-hop album, but it
        has spread throughout America physically and digitally and has caused Ritchie to gain a significant following
        against the government.</p>
    <p>Mass protests have already broken out, and it is surprising to see just how many people were inspired by and
        followed Ritchie. Police have already started to respond violently to these protests.</p>
    <p>The future of the Miller Government seems uncertain. There is much pressure calling for the resignation of the
        president, to an even higher degree than we saw 8 years ago. These next few months could be critical in shaping
        the future of the United States.</p>

    <h2>Miller's Government starts harsh crackdown on protesters of the 28th Amendment</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <h4>January 23, 2038</h4>
    <p>Protests that have been widespread throughout the entire country for the past few months have started to receive
        violent crackdowns by the Miller Government.</p>
    <p>These protests started late last year in response to the ratification of the 23rd Amendment, which many Americans
        feel is suppressing their freedom. Though they have remained mostly peaceful, there have been cases where
        violence escalated with police and cases of looting, which caused Miller to crack down on these protests.</p>
    <p>“These protests have become too violent and out of control. They need to be stopped,” Miller said at a press
        conference.</p>
    <p>Protesters across America have been beaten and arrested in masses by the police, and there have been a few cases
        of deaths of protesters.</p>
    <p>It seems that the anti-government protests will come to a halt in the coming weeks, and it seems unlikely there
        will be another protest attempt at such a massive scale.</p>

    <h2>The 28th Amendment is ratified by Congress</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <h4>May 14, 2037</h4>
    <p>After a surprising result, the 28th Amendment is passed by Congress.</p>
    <p>The amendment essentially disrupts the balance of power of the government by giving the current President Miller
        as much power as he pleases. Since this ratification, he has passed new laws, restricting some of the rights of
        American Citizens, as well as removing the presidential term limit.</p>
    <p>Firstly, it is now illegal to speak negatively of the government. You are also not allowed to display things
        considered “un-Christian,” “un-American,” or “anti-government.” Doing so will lead to arrest. Crosses are now
        legally required in every building, whether public or private. This includes all homes.</p>
    <p>The music industry was hit especially hard. Any music with profanities is automatically banned. Songs where the
        sounds or lyrics are considered “against the government's interests” have been banned as well. Hip-Hop has been
        hit the hardest by this, where it is almost completely banned because of its “gangster tendencies that incite
        violence in people.”</p>
    <p>Many Americans are dissatisfied with this ratification, and some have started to protest in the streets. While
        they remain peaceful for now, time will only tell how these protests will develop.</p>

    <h2>Charles Miller elected as the 50th President of the United States</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <h4>January 6, 2036</h4>
    <p>After a rather tumultuous election, Charles Miller is elected president of the United States, winning both the
        popular vote and electoral college votes. Miller has announced he plans to execute his ideas of creating a more
        “Christian America”. He is backed up by the Congress and Senate, so it is believed he will be able to pass his
        laws with ease.</p>
    <p>The result of the election seems to have a mixed reception from Americans. While some are very satisfied with the
        idea of bringing back a more Christian America, others are worried.</p>
    <p>“I’m worried about Miller being in office now. I fear he'll start taking away our civil liberties in the name of
        religion. I hope that I will be wrong about this, but the future looks bleak to me,” said one worried voter.</p>
    <p>While it is unclear if this comment has any merit, only time will tell whether this becomes true or not.</p>
    <p>As the next few months unfold, we will surely see what President Miller will take the direction of his new
        Christian America.</p>
